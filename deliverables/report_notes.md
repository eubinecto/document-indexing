## How should you write the report? (answers to the questions raised in the lab)
- Back your argument with evidence. Use evaluation metrics. (e.g. NDCG). Hand-lable docs for a specific query, 
As for MapReduce; two attempts have been made.
- focus on the depth. -> provide concrete examples, wherever you can
- Make sure to keep it brief. Brevity is the hardest part of all.
- word count matters. get rid of the questions once you are done with the answers.
- for in-depth analysis, you must provide examples. (For both to prove something is useful
  as well as something is not).
- do some book work?
come up with a motivation for every feature you put in. Don't forget to be critical.
- collect all the output variations, and show different search results for the same query
- make sure you cite the slides!
- as for word count, just use `wc` command in terminal.
